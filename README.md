# Live Coding on Twitch

On the Live Video platform, Twitch, we are a group of broadcasters who write code and make things while teaching viewers.  We believe that live video is an amazing opportunity to teach, and want to share our expertise.  You can find the team's home page on Twitch at:  https://twitch.tv/team/livecoders

## Qualifications

We want to ensure that broadcasters on the team are makers who have made a commitment to broadcast on the Twitch platform with a positive and welcoming atmosphere.  Members and prospective members:

  1. Twitch Affiliate or Partner status
  1. During broadcasts, politely answer questions from viewers
  1. Promote a positive, inclusive, and welcoming chat room
  1. Are a person, not a brand or company account
  1. Regularly write code or make hardware with technology.  Other content is cool

Live coder team members will review and ensure that prospective channels meet these requirements before admitting new members to the team.
