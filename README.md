# Live Coding on Twitch

On the Live Video platform, Twitch, we are a group of broadcasters who write code and make things while teaching viewers.  We believe that live video is an amazing opportunity to teach, and want to share our expertise.  You can find the team's home page at: https://livecoders.dev however, you can go directly to the Team directory on Twitch at: https://twitch.tv/team/livecoders

## Applications
We are once again reviewing applications on a regular basis, roughly once a month as of June 2022

## Qualifications

We want to ensure that broadcasters on the team are makers who have made a commitment to broadcast on the Twitch platform with a positive and welcoming atmosphere.  Members and prospective members:

  1. Are at least 18 years of age.
  1. Twitch Affiliate or Partner status.
  1. Minimum of 5 average viewers over the last 30 days.
  1. During broadcasts, politely answer questions from viewers.
  1. Promote a positive, inclusive, and welcoming chat room (we discourage excessive Blue Comedy/Ribaldry).
  1. Regularly write code or make hardware with technology. Other content is cool.
  1. Are a person, not a brand or company account.

Live coder team members will review and ensure that prospective channels meet these requirements before admitting new members to the team.  Reviews are conducted at the end of each month.  Please don't be discouraged if it takes some time for feedback.
