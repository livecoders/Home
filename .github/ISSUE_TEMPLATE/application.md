**Why do you write code on stream?**

* I get a lot more feedback streaming than I ever did at my previous full-time job of 20+ years.
* Live-streaming forces me to make a plan, stay organized, and get motivated.
* I enjoy helping others who have questions about programming, or could benefit from watching how I develop code.
* I get a lot of practice speaking: describing what I'm doing, answering questions.
* Viewers of my channel share lot of interesting things: different points of view, useful tools I didn't know about before, and their own projects which I enjoy seeing.
* Facing the community and their criticism, even the trolling, helps me "grow a thicker skin".

**What is your favorite moment from coding on stream?  Share a clip if one is available**

I was being hosted by Adam13531 one day, and he logged into my game as I was working on it.  I don't remember why exactly (maybe it was to demonstrate making changes to the game while live?) but I gave Adam's character the ability to swim.  Almost immediately, Adam shot across the water and killed a special named NPC named "Slimy" that I had been using for tests.  RIP Slimy!  :FeelsBadMan: :LUL:  Anyway, it was funny, but it also highlighted the kind of viewer interaction I'm shooting for with my game, where viewers can interact with the stream and the game in a more integrated way than most games.
